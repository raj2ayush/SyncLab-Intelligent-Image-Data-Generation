# SyncLab : Intelligent Image Dataset Generation System

## Introduction
Creating diverse test data for vision AI is challenging. Traditional methods involve manual website scanning, prone to biases. Existing datasets often lack specificity, restrictions on the number of images, and might face copyright issues. Our project proposes an NLP-driven solution to revolutionize dataset creation, particularly for emotion detection.

## Scope of Project
1. **Query Expansion:** Enhancing search queries for accuracy.
2. **Image Scraping:** Automated methods for data retrieval.
3. **Model Assessment:** Evaluating dataset quality using complex models.
4. **Data Augmentation:** Enhancing dataset diversity through augmentation.

## Methodology
Addressing the challenge of laborious and time-consuming creation of test data for various vision AI solutions, this project aims to streamline the process through innovative methodologies. The primary focus is on enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in web scraping and image extraction, while also optimizing dataset quality for diverse use cases.

1. **Query Expansion Techniques:** Leveraging NLP models, we expand queries to retrieve a broader spectrum of keywords, facilitating comprehensive internet image searches and enhancing dataset richness.

2. **Image Scraper Methods:** Employing automated solutions via Selenium, Google, and Flicker API, we automate image dataset creation, ensuring adherence to specific requirements, thus eliminating manual labor and enhancing efficiency.

3. **Complex Model Assessment for Dataset Validation:** Employing a sophisticated Emotion Detection model founded on Complex Computer Vision and AI, we rigorously evaluate dataset quality, emphasizing precision and diversity for optimal model performance.

4. **Data Augmentation:** Implementing image augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling, we diversify and enrich the quality of the dataset, improving model robustness and performance.

This methodology ensures efficient, accurate, and diverse creation of test data for vision AI solutions, addressing the challenges posed by manual labor and generic search engines.
